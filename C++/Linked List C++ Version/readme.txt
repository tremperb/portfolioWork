Description: This program implements linked nodes via classes. It utilizes two classes Linked_List(.cpp & .h) & Linked_List_Node(.h) which gets a new node. Each
node points to the next making them linked. In the Linked list class it holds a pointer to our linked list node for all first value which will point to all the 
others utilizing next. There is also a Linked List Node pointer called new_node which acts as a holder of sorts through the program so it does not need to
redefined everytime. Upon my test all functions appear to work correctly. This list utilizes sorting both ascending & descending, printing, clear/deleting, 
getting prime numbers, and adding values to both the front, back, and at specified index in the list. All memory is deleted in the program and everything appears
to work. All of this is testing a small program implemented in the list class which handles error checking aswell. The main program simply just calls the 
function play_game() to test the functionality of our program(even though not everything is used in this). 

NOTE: No extra credit is implemented so class only accepts integers

 Homework Assignment 4 - Euclidian MST Implementation using prims algorithm

# mstEuclid.cpp using graph.cpp, node.cpp, and point.cpp

This program was created and compile with c++.
In order to compile this, connect to the oregon state flip server in your terminal.
With this navigate to the corresponding folder to compile these.
Use:

g++ mstEuclid.cpp graph.cpp point.cpp node.cpp

a.out [your graph.txt file]

EX:
g++ mstEuclid.cpp graph.cpp point.cpp node.cpp

a.out graph.txt

This will compile the algorithm taking into account the implementation classes
to use to calculate the distance between each point (x,y) --> (x,y) via a minimum spanning tree
where the overall distance will be shown on the bottom as total distance.

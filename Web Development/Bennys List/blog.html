        <h3> <em> Getting Started! <u> 10/2/2019 </u> </em> </h3>
          <p style="text-indent: 4em">
          For this first assignment it took a bit to understand how to get
          everything setup. I installed Atom to help and linked it to my github
          desktop application. I attempted to hook atom directly up to github but
          it wouldn't do it. Instead I just wrote and commited my pages on atom
          but had to return to github desktop to actually push them through.
          Once I got everything setup it was smooth sailing for the most part.
          I messed around with the various tags used in the lecture slides and with
          the skeleton template everything was easy to do. I did have slight trouble
          viewing both my pages on the web but with the help of Piazza, I saw told
          that I need to type my blog url in directly as I could only see my index.
          This helped me pigure everything out to create a functional webpage for my
          first assignment with minor difficulties! </p>

        <h3> <em> Styling with CSS! <u> 10/20/2019 </u> </em> </h3>
          <p style="text-indent: 4em">
            When working with CSS for the first time I had some challenges. When
            attempting to target a specific element I had some troubles at first to
            get the right element selected. Upon figuring out all the specific syntaxes
            for the containers and classes and names I was able to get things started.
            Also, I had a bit of trouble figuring out the order of listing the CSS code for
            each element so it could actually be displayed how I imagined. Following that
            every thing went fairly smooth, I had a bit of trouble get the input boxes to fit
            as I was trying to find a way to make them fit with a specific line of code but I
            ended up just seperating each individual element and making them have a specific
            width. After figuring out all these specifics I was able to get used to the use
            of CSS. Now I have an idea of how to work with it and apply it to my future assignemnts!

        <h3> <em> Starting with JavaScript! <u> 11/8/2019 </u> </em> </h3>
          <p style="text-indent: 4em">
            When viewing the assignment we had to implement with javascript, the most
            challenging part for myself was adding new elements and filtering objects
            based on their condition. Adding elements took some time to figure out the specific
            approach ragrding syntax for each element but once I was able to search
            specific syntax approaches for javascript I was able to finish the function
            for adding elements with ease. Following this I attempted filter my objects.
            These all came easily until I got to filtering by condition, since multiple conditions
            could be entered for a single search it made things slightly more difficult.
            Instead of removing it if it wasn't equal I had to sort through and get all those that
            wern't selected and then remove those so I could remove more than one object.
            Upon getting all of these issues sorted I was able to finish the assignment in
            a timely manner and get a solid base for using javascript on websites!

          <h3> <em> Starting with node.js! <u> 11/17/2019 </u> </em> </h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 4em">
              When viewing the assignment the most challenging part for myself was
              figuring out what the assignment was actually asking me to do. Without
              any experience with node I was a bit unsure whata it was asking for until
              the final lecture before the assignment was due and people discussing on piazza
              with similar concerns. Upon figuring out what we were doing I found everything to
              slide into place quite easily. However, after I got everything in place how I believed it
              to be I still wasn't positive on how to test it, however right as I was about to ask on piazza,
              someone posted the same problem and got a response! This made piazza my most helpful
              tool for this assignment as it allowed to to actually figure out how to test my code. With this
              I was able to run my code through git bash and view it via local host in my browser which I
              actually think is really cool! Now with everything figured out I had to make a few adjustments
              to my code and everything worked great! This tool seems quite helpful and will
              definetly be one I use in the future!

# Event Calendar

This is a prototype of an event calendar site which is hosted through node.js. 

Currently, it displays a dynamically created calendar on the home page with the ability
to add events to the calendar where they can be seen as well as a link to a page with lists all events.

To fully view this you can run it on a local host by the command "npm start"
this will then allow the prototype of the site to be viewed on localhost:1324

This is just a prototype so it is not actively hosted. 
Future Implementations? Make account page for organizations, each organization has their own list of 
events. This will allow for a useful planner for oragnizations to use similarily to google calendar
but more adapted for groups.
